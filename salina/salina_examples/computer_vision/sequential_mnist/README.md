# Sequential MNIST Classification

We ilustrate how `salina` can be used for sequential classification using MNIST dataset. We implemented the experimental setting and architecture described on the paper ["A Simple Way to Initialize Recurrent Networks of Rectified Linear Units"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1504.00941). The code obtains accuracy of around 80% for 1M iterations, which aligns with the [task reproducibility benchmark](https://paperswithcode.com/sota/sequential-image-classification-on-sequential).
